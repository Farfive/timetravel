# Time Travel Simulation AI ML

![Time Travel Simulation](time_travel_simulation.jpg)

This repository contains the code for a fascinating time travel simulation project that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to render stunning images and videos of a time traveler moving through time. The project employs Blender for rendering and computer vision techniques to track the time traveler's movements. Additionally, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate the immersive environments for the time travel simulation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Blender
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Once you have installed the required dependencies, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/time-travel-simulation.git`.
2. Open the `main.py` file in a Python IDE of your choice.
3. Adjust the `TIME_TRAVELER_SPEED` variable to control the speed of the time traveler through time.
4. Run the `main.py` file.

## Results

The project will generate an exciting series of images and videos capturing the time traveler's journey through time. These captivating media files will be saved to the `results` directory within the repository.

## To-Do

The project is an ongoing endeavor, and there are several improvements and features planned for the future, including:

- Enhancing the accuracy of computer vision-based tracking techniques for more seamless time traveler movements.
- Refining the GAN-based environment generation to create even more realistic and visually stunning scenes.
- Introducing additional interactive features, allowing the time traveler to interact with objects in the simulated environment.
